Other than that it's a lovely atmosphere staff are polite and offer free parking for customers with a ticket available at the bar, oh! And its dog friendly üòÅ",

Very friendly, and helpful, staff and dog friendly too.\r\nAs soon as we entered we were asked if we had any special dietary requirements, and if we wanted to see a vegan menu.\r\nComplimentary water and treats were made available for our dog (who will never say no to food). Thoroughly recommended.",

Views of Portland and the Jurassic coast, stretching out to sea as far as the eye can see. Then in the fields deer and wildlife. Its dog friendly. It is absolutely my favourite place in the summer. Foods great, a huge range of drinks. You have to check it out! Just don't steal all the outside seats when I want to go there!",

Really tasty coffee (even the decaf with oat milk), freshly squeezed orange juice available & treats for the dogs. They even will give you a water bowl for your dog if you've forgotten yours. We only waited 5 minutes for a table even though it was busy & service was very quick. Parking might be tricky as it is on street, but well worth it if you can get here!",

There were a few things not available on the menu and then the killjoy, the Chef could not guarantee any fried items, normally ok for anyone with a crustacean allergy, would be ok for me to eat because the fryer wasn't cleaned properly. Did not present any alternatives and that did not leave me with many options to choose from and we sadly had to look for and book another place for lunch.\r\n\r\nThe young lady serving us tried very hard, and they were all very friendly towards our dog as well. I think we chose a day when they were not at their best.\r\n\r\nThen again, if you are open, you should be, right?",

I like the atmosphere, decor and the team are friendly and generally attentive although sometimes there is a bit of a wait on food when they're busy. It's dog friendly which is a plus. If you're looking for a venue in Brockley then you can't go wrong with The Orchard. Recommended.",
